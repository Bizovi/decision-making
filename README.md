# Decision-making under uncertainty

This repository emerges out of teaching data science to students of various backgrounds and my practice in the industry. I aspire to contribute to the understanding of this complex landscape and teach people how to navigate it, how to develop valuable skills, and become more effective at problem-solving.

That's it, whatever will be published here can't be the be-all-end-all bootcamp or course. But here are a few of my beliefs, which may persuade you to take the long road to your own development in AI instead of searching for "the tutorial":

- There is no shortcut to a deep understanding of a domain, especially an interconnected network of fields and communities being in an evolving dialogue
- There is no shortcut to being skillful at something
- The journey from novice to expert is not linear, however, the "interest compounds"
- The journey need not be painful, but it can be seriously playful,a source of wonder and meaning
- Without skin in the game, we can't claim we truly get something
- Without a vision which is flexible enough, but at the same time long-lived:
    - In the case of rigidity - there is a risk of being stuck, rigid, or pursue obsessively, counterproductively, and getting fooled
    - In the case of everything goes - there is a risk of wandering aimlessly and not finding a home
- Fixating on beliefs and propositional knowing (the facts!) is counterproductive. Which should put into question all written above
- Fixating on skills makes you lose the grasp of the big picture
