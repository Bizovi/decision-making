## Three critical questions

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![*Source: [Kim Warren](https://strategydynamics.com/free/assets/The%20Dynamics%20of%20Strategy,%202016.pdf), Strategic Management Dynamics * -- Status Quo, Desired and Feared Trajectories](img/trajectories.png){width="90%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **What** happened (data / facts) and **Why** (inference)
- **Where** are we likely going if we do things as before?
    - Is it a feared scenario?
    - What contributes to it?
- **How** to achieve the desired trajectory? Is it realistic?
:::

::: {.aside}
Remember VUCA? Complex Systems?

## Trajectories and good ol' SWOT

:::: {.callout-tip}

## Ecommerce selling apparel. What do they want? What should they do?

$\max$ **Top line** (revenue) | **bottom line** (EBITDA) | customer **satisfaction**.

- Status Quo: what is most likely trajectory? What contributes to it?
    - looks good $\implies$ strengths 
    - looks bad or unsatisfactory $\implies$ weaknesses
- Feared trajectory (shocks, risks, macro environment, competition): 
    - scenario looks bad $\implies$ threats
- Desired trajectory. Is it reasonable and realistically achievable? 
    - if yes $\implies$ opportunities

::::

## Tradeoffs: it depends

- What if it's a startup that received big funding?
- What if it wants to capture market share?
- What if the goal is to have sustainable profitability?
- What if they position themselves as luxury?

> The question we asked is too generic. We need a **strategy** and possible decisions, constraints in their **value chain**

::: {.aside}
What is the optimal tradeoff between objectives? In which part of value chain should they take action? What is the firm's strategy?
:::

## Principle nr. 8

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="font-size:60px"}
What is true and how should I act?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![You should have those questions in mind not just at the job](img/making_choices.png){width="90%"}
:::
::::

::: {.aside}
More nuanced: likely, plausible, with convergent evidence. "Seeing clearly"
:::

## What is a strategy anyways?

NOT just **aspiration** towards goal or a **vision** or a **target**.

| Step | Outcome | Characteristics
|------|-------|------|
| Honest diagnosis | Identify obstacles |     Few critical, relevant aspects
| Guiding policy |  General approach to overcome | Focused on key aspects
| Coherent actions | Support policy with action plan   |  Coordinated and focused

::: {.aside}
When it comes to setting good goals, you might've heard of SMART
:::

## Principle nr. 9

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Know your firm's strategy. Call out bad strategy.
:::

::: {.aside}
First ask, understand, contribute. Challenge if situation allows.

## Business Analysts' Workflow


![*Source: [Adam Fleischhacker](https://causact.com)*; This process is highly iterative and depends on having good feedback and collaboration](img/analyst-workflow.png "Analysis"){width="90%"}


## Characteristics of this process

- **Outcome-focused**: What's the point otherwise?
- **Strategically-aligned**: Not all outcomes are equal!
- **Action-oriented**: Biggest pitfall of any AI/ML initiative -- when it's not actionable!
    - Needs clear and persuasive communication
- **Computationally rigorous**: 
    - Correctness, reproducibility and maintainability
    - Accesible: idealy in an app which users explore

## Principle nr. 10

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="font-size:60px"}
Don't get too enamored with exploratory data analysis

## Other processes to be aware of

- Scientific process (it's not "the science says ...")
    - Statistics and experiment design (12 steps)
    - Causal inference
- Machine Learning (12 steps)
- CRISP-DM, Tuckey's EDA
- Software Development, Product Management
    - Algorithmic/computational problem-solving


## Value Chain meets Decision Science

![*Source: [bayesianquest](https://bayesianquest.com/2018/11/13/data-science-strategy-safari-aligning-data-science-strategy-to-org-strategy/) -- Data Science Strategy Safari*. This framework was useful in my role as the Head of Data Science](img/ds_strategic_alliance.webp){width="80%"}


## Principle nr. 11

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Understand what thy buzzwords mean
:::

::: {.aside}
AI, Analytics, Big Data, Generative AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Cybernetics
:::

## Weak AI

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale
:::

- domain-specific (medicine vs finance vs automotive ...)
- data-driven (key idea of learning from data)
- varying, limited degrees of autonomy
- sometimes concerned with networks of agents

::: {.aside}
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Michael Jordan - Stop calling everything AI
:::

## Cybernetics is the OG AI

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
The science of *general regularities* of *control* and *information processing* in animal, machine and human
:::

::: {.aside}
What? Let's unpack this
:::


## Unpacking Cybernetics

- **Control** $\implies$ **goal-directedness**. Action to steer to a trajectory or autopoesis (perserve $(S-f)_{org}$)
- **Information Processing** $\implies$ pattern recoginition, perception, modeling & inference
- **General regularities** $\implies$ plausible of control and information processing across fields and CAS
- Animal refers to applications in biology, machine -- in engineering, and human -- in our society and behavior.


::: {.aside}
In economic cybernetics, we're concerned with economics, society and human behavior, rather than engineering, biology, or natural science applications.
:::




## Analytics vs ML vs Stats


![*Source: xkcd;* Instead of Stats, I would say we want Causal Inference](img/ds-adventure.png "Analysis"){width="80%"}

## Principle nr. 12

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Analytics is for inspiration. Formulating a hypothesis is a science and art
:::

::: {.aside}
Think of a good analyst, as a detective. One can also model, but still do analytics
:::

## Principle nr. 13

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
When doing ML, split your damn data
:::

- is there a pattern to be found?
- do we have relevant data?
- $\implies$ we're in business of ML!

::: {.aside}
Many ML and Statistical models are like a geocentic model -- good at prediction, but the underlying mechanism is wrong
:::

## Principle nr. 14

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Often in ML, you use predictions for optimization
:::

- make sure loss function is aligned with the business cost
- make sure you're not over/under-fitting

::: {.aside}
In business applications, it's not enough just to predict. What do you do about it?
:::

## Principle nr. 15

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
You can't derive a theory using data alone
:::

- Causal Inference is harder than ML
- You want to know the consequences of your intervention
- Theory $\longrightarrow ...$ Causal Model + Data $\longrightarrow$ New insight

::: {.aside}
Causal inference can also be seen as a problem of inferring/predicting missing data
:::


## Principle nr. 16

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Statistics is about changing your action and mind under evidence
:::

- Under what circumstances would I change my default action?
    - Does the evidence make my $H_0$ ridiculous?
    - Is it due to chance?


## Roles in firms: Stuff data people do

- Data Engineering -- pipelines and infrastructure
- Data Analysts -- detectives, decision support
- BI -- infrastructure for reporting, clean, modeled data
- ML Engineer -- builds ML models and deploys them
- Data Scientist -- jack of all trades, often lots of stats
- Product Analyst -- cares about experiments
- Decision Makers & Domain Experts are usually the clients

::: {.aside}
Everyone deals with data, even BE, FE, Decision-Makers, QA, DevOPS, domain experts

	- [x] example of the large hadron collider -- data vs underlying mechanism, which we want to test and we have a theory 
	- [x] example of the quality control -- there is a source for randomness -->

## At some point, we'll discuss

- AI product management:
    - PAIR: People+AI research (Google)
    - Event Storming
    - Ethics and controversies of AI
- Full Stack data apps
    - ML Systems and technical debt
    - Computational Reproducibility
- Replication crisis
    - Media and Bullshit

## More on course philosophy

- Motivation for why is something important (method, idea, model, process, ...)
- Develop conceptual understanding and intuition
    - Theoretical rigor only where necessary
- Use simulations as a safe playground
- Practical and realistic applications
    - problem formulation: focus on decision-making
    - start with simplest models
    - deal with messy data and introduce more realism

## The danger of thinking in buckets

Here is R. Sapolsky's argument about studying different aspects of human behavior:

- Our brains think about stuff in buckets / boundaries
- These buckets influence our memory, language, behavior
- We stop seeing the big picture:
    - Bad at differentiating facts within buckets
    - Exagerrate differences between buckets
- Tempting to claim that a bucket is the only, true explanation
- Some of the most influential scientists fell into this trap

## We'll walk across many buckets

- **Problem space**: the CAS of a firm, but not only
- **Cognitive science**: intelligence, rationality, foolishness
- **Probability Theory**: Reason under uncertainty, DAGs, DGPs
- **Statistics**: formulating hypotheses, experiment design
- **Machine Learning**: next year we focus on predictions
- **Computer Science**: how to make the stuff usable
- **Philosophy**: ethics, epistemiology, phil. science
- **Mathematics**: elegant abstractions and tools

## And take short trips and detours
